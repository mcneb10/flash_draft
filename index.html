  <h3 id="thesis">In the stories Raymonds Run and Thank you ma'am
the theme is the same. It is be respectfull and things will be better.</h3>
You need to know that the story Raymonds Run is about a girl name Squeaky who protects his disabled brother Raymond fiercely.
She has no friends because she always is really mean to people who even comes close to Raymond. 
And thank you ma'am is about a boy who steals and wants to buy blue suede shoes and he tries to steal a pocketbook from a woman
and she teaches him respect by taking him to her house for dinner. Then she gives him the money he needs to buy the shoes.
  </h3>

  <h3>
  In the story Raymonds Run the theme is be respectful and things will be better because when she is mean people hate her and when she is nice people like her.
We see this when Squeaky is mean to Gretchen she makes fun of her, and when Squeaky is nice to her she is nice back.
Also when Squeaky is nice she feels happy herself. We see this when Squeaky says, "Maybe Gretchen could help me coach Raymond".

	In the story thank you ma'am the theme is be respectfull and things will be better because when he is nice to the lady she is nice back and when he
steals her pocketbook she is mad. We see this when he goes at night and grabs the womans pocketbook. 
When he eats at her house when he listens to her he is respectful and she is respectful back.
We see in the text after he is respectfull enough he gets the money to buy the blue suede shoes he wants.

<h3> 
In the stories Raymonds Run and Thank You Ma'am the themes are the same. They are be respectfull and things will better.
We have evidence because in Raymonds Run we see when squeaky is respectful to Gretchen she is respectful back.
And in Thank You Ma'am when the boy listens to the woman and is respectful she is respectful back.
</h3>
</p>
<p>
<h3>
So basically Thank You Ma'am and Raymonds Run have the same theme.
In the stories we see the theme slowly unfold and we figure out what the theme is. Be respectful and things will be better.
In conclusion they both have the same theme.
